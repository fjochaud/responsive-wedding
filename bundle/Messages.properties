header_dir = Directions
text_dir_bzh = To get there, you need to aim for Vannes. To get to Vannes, you have several solutions: \
<ul> \
  <li>Take a plane to Paris, then take a train to Vannes (if you're flying in to CDG, you can take a train from there directly, if you arrive to Orly, you might be able to take a train from ''Massy TGV''. In any case, look at <a href='http://en.voyages-sncf.com/en/'>voyage SNCF</a> for more info)</li> \
  <li>Take a plane to Nantes Atlantique and then take a shuttle to Nantes central station and take a train to Vannes. Again look at <a href='http://en.voyages-sncf.com/en/'>voyage SNCF</a> for more info.</li> \
  <li>Do the same than the first 2 solutions but replace the train part with a bus. See <a href='http://www.rome2rio.com/fr/s/A%C3%A9roport-de-Nantes-NTE/Vannes'>rome2rio</a> for example.</li> \
  <li>Do the same than the first 2 solutions but replace the train part with a ride sharing. See <a href='https://www.blablacar.fr/trajets/nantes/vannes/'>Blablacar</a> for possible solutions.</li> \
  <li>Do the same than the first 2 solutions but rent a car for the last part. The normal ones are your friends, you can also check the private renting at <a href='https://www.drivy.com/'>Drivy</a> which is cheaper but get fast, there's less options.</li> \
  <li>A combination of any other options above...</li> \
</ul> \
<p/>Contact us at  <a href="mailto:contact@tally-and-florent.info">contact@tally-and-florent.info</a> if you want advice figuring out this part or want to pool resources. We can put you in touch with other guests coming the same way.\
<p/>From the Mairie in Séné, you can ask for a ride, attempt to hitchike, or take the 7 Bus towards Kerozer for 25 minutes (departs every 20 minutes) and get off at Le Dôme. From there it is a 20 minute walk, please download a map before you attempt this! Or grab some people and call a cab together. Also, if you have a car with some place in it, let others know, it&#39;ll be good karma.
